The use of semantic tags in web development has numerous benefits,
as they help improve the overall accessibility and SEO of a website.
Semantic tags help visually impaired users to navigate websites more effectively, 
as these tags indicate the purpose and structure of the content. Additionally,
search engines also utilize these tags to better understand the content and context of web pages,
which can result in better rankings and visibility.
Lastly, semantic tags help developers to write cleaner and more organized code,
leading to improved maintainability and scalability.
