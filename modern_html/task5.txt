Tab index is a feature that allows keyboard users to navigate through websites using the "Tab" key. 
The tab index order is determined by the website developer, 
and it can include links, form fields, 
buttons, and other interactive elements.
This feature is especially important for users who rely on assistive technologies to access the web.
By setting a logical tab order, developers can ensure that their website is fully accessible to all users, 
regardless of their input method.
